## Things you'll need

1. node.js and npm installed (version 0.10 or newer should be fine)
2. some kind of terminal or command prompt where you can run commands
3. a text editor of your choice. I'll be using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) but most any will do.
4. A free account on GitHub.com with at least one "repo" in it. If you don't have one [create one here](https://github.com/) and then follow instructions to create a repo. It doesn't even have to have anything in it, just needs to exist.
5. a browser, yup... duh :)

## Getting set up

If you already have node.js, npm, and git installed you should be able to get the app in this repo running by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/masters.git
cd masters
npm install
```

Now run `npm start`, this will start the development server (it won't finish it'll just keep running). Then open http://localhost:3000 in a browser if you see a message that says: "Hello Frontend Masters!" you're ready.
